        <p><em><strong>MSc</strong> in Architecture and Urbanism</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>I am an Architect with the MSc deegre. I was born and raised in a Kotor Montenegro.
        Kotor is the coastal town with the spirit of 15th and 17th centuries,
        as such it has given me many inspirations for my work. Studing Architecture and having worked in architectural firms,
        has expended my skill sets, creativity and opend my horizonts for new things.
        I learned a lot of about time management and how to think quick and systematic so
        I would emphasized this as my advantage.
        I love architecture that truly enriches the human expirience and showes it's beaty in the simple architectural form.
        At the end, the architect job is to satisfy clients needs, otherwise it is not the Architecture.
